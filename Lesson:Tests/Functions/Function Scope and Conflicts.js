// When you create a function, the variables and other things
// defined inside the function are inside their own separate
// scope, meaning that they are locked away in their own separate 
// compartments, unreachable from inside other functions or
// from code outside the functions

// The top level outside all your functions is called the 
// global scope. Values defined in the global scope
// are accessible from everywhere in the code
